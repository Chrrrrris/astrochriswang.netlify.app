              Area of expertise: exoplanet atmosphere and observational astronomy.
              * Incorporated nested sampling and MCMC with gaussian prior to FIREFLy (group's JWST reduction pipeline). 
              * Developed FIREFLy to be capable of JWST NIRISS-SOSS data.
              * Extracted transmission spectra for HAT-P-14b <b>(Liu & Wang et al., 2025)</b>, WASP-96b <b>(Wang et al., Submitted)</b>, and K2-18b <b>(Schmidt et al., 2025)</b> with JWST NIRISS SOSS. Performed atmospheric retrieval jointly with data from various other observatories, e.g. VLT, HST, Spitzer, JWST-NIRSpec.

            Area of expertise: planet formation, computational astrophysics, stellar structures, and data science.
            * Assembled photometry for every star
            confirmed as an open cluster member by Gaia. Developed algorithms that fit
            HR-diagrams and reject unresolved binary stars.
            * Studied elemental abundances of exoplanet hosting stars. Combining stellar evolution simulations (MESA), we showed there is no relationship between stellar photospheric elemental abundance pattern and planet formation <b>(Wang & Schlaufman, in prep.)</b>.
            * investigate the relative importance between pebble accretion and planetesimal accretion to the outcomes of planet formation directly with numerical simulations and exoplanet demographics.
