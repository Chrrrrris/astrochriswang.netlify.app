My name is Le-Chris Wang (王乐). I am an incoming PhD student at Astrophysical Science Department of Princeton University. I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University double majoring in computer science, physics (with emphasis on astrophysics) with minors in mathematics and applied mathematics and statistics. My research focus is exoplanets, specifically their formation and atmospheres. I am especially interested in how planets like the Earth came into being, and whether there exists similar worlds like ours in the universe. I use both numerical simulations to study the theoretical outcomes of planet formation and a combination of space-based and ground-based observations to characterize exoplanets.

At Hopkins, I work with <a href="http://www.kevinschlaufman.com/" class = "link">Prof. Kevin Schlaufman </a> and <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/about/people/matt-clement" class = "link">Dr. Matthew Clement </a> on theories of planet formation. I also work with <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/david-sing/" class = "link">Prof. David Sing</a> and <a href="https://zafarrustamkulov.com/" class = "link">Zafar Rustamkulov </a> on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST and a variety of ground-based observatories.
