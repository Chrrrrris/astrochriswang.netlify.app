My name is Le-Chris Wang (王乐). I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/" class = "link">Astrophysical Science Department of Princeton University</a>. My research focus is exoplanets, specifically their formation, demographics, and atmospheres. I use both numerical simulations to study the theoretical outcomes of planet formation and a combination of space-based and ground-based observations to characterize exoplanets.

During my undergrad at Hopkins, I worked with <a href="http://www.kevinschlaufman.com/" class = "link">Prof. Kevin Schlaufman </a> and <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/about/people/matt-clement" class = "link">Dr. Matthew Clement </a> on theories of planet formation. I also worked with <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/david-sing/" class = "link">Prof. David Sing</a> and <a href="https://zafarrustamkulov.com/" class = "link">Zafar Rustamkulov </a> on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST and a variety of ground-based observatories.
