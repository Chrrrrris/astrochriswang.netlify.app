My name is Chris "Le" Wang (王乐). I am a senior undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University triple majoring in computer science, physics (with emphasis on astrophysics), and applied mathematics & statistics. My research focus is exoplanets, specifically their formation and atmospheres. I am especially interested in how planets like the Earth came into being, and whether there exists similar worlds like ours in the universe. I use both numerical simulations to study the theoretical outcomes of planet formation and a combination of space-based and ground-based observations to characterize exoplanets.

At Hopkins, I work with <a href="http://www.kevinschlaufman.com/" class = "link">Prof. Kevin Schlaufman </a> and <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/about/people/matt-clement" class = "link">Dr. Matthew Clement </a> on theories of planet formation. I also work with <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/david-sing/" class = "link">Prof. David Sing</a> and <a href="https://zafarrustamkulov.com/" class = "link">Zafar Rustamkulov </a> on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST and a variety of ground-based observatories.
